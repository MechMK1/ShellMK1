# ShellMK1
ShellMK1 is a small project designed to hold a variety of useful aliases, functions, snippets, etc...
The majority of these code-fragments will require certain versions of Bash, certain features enabled, etc.
That means, they are either designed to be as easily-understood as possible or I was just too lazy to write a hack for every version of bash back to 0.1a

## FAQ
Q: I get error '...' when trying to do '...'
A: Make an issue and I'll look into it someday. However, no promises.

Q: Feature '...' would be really cool in '...'
A: See above.

Q: Your way of doing '...' is wrong/error-prone/slow. Better use '...'
A: I'll gladly merge pull requests

Q: You totally stole that code from one of my answers on StackOverflow
A: Sorry! Some of these snippets were pulled from .bash_aliases backups from 2006.
If you want propper attribution or want me to remove it from my repository, just say so and I'll try to respond as soon as I can.
